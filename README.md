CS 255 Portfolio – DriverPass System Design
Project Overview

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for DriverPass, a company that provides driving test preparation services. The client required a web-based system that allows students to register, purchase lesson packages, schedule on-the-road driving lessons, and take online practice exams. The system also supports administrative and instructional staff while ensuring security, usability, and scalability.

What I Did Well

I performed particularly well in analyzing the client interview transcript and translating those requirements into clear system documentation. I successfully identified user roles, system functionality, and constraints, and represented them using UML diagrams such as use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams. These models clearly communicate how the system should function and how its components interact.

Area for Improvement

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would enhance the level of detail in some UML diagrams by adding additional edge cases and alternative flows. This would provide developers with more clarity when implementing the system and help anticipate potential errors or exceptional scenarios.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted user needs by carefully reviewing the DriverPass interview transcript and identifying both functional and nonfunctional requirements. These needs were incorporated into the system design through defined user roles, system workflows, and security considerations. Considering user needs is critical because a system must be intuitive and aligned with user expectations to be successful.

My Approach to Software Design

My approach to software design begins with understanding the problem before proposing technical solutions. I use techniques such as requirements analysis, UML modeling, and iterative refinement to ensure designs align with user needs and business goals. In the future, I will continue to apply structured documentation and visual modeling techniques when analyzing and designing systems.
